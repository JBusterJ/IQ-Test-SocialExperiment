					Visitors from the current year, this website has now been discontinued
					and has been revived as a revamped archive for the purpose of
					training. If you would like to access the updated Mensa IQ Challenge,
					please visit the new Mensa - The High IQ Society website and purchase
					an examination. Though, if you score above 150 IQ on this challenge, you can appeal for a Mensa IQ Test for free, via the Mensa website.

					An IQ test is an assessment that measures a range of cognitive
					abilities and provides a score that is intended to serve as a measure
					of an individual's intellectual abilities and potential. IQ tests are
					among the most commonly administered psychological tests.
					<br /><br />IQ, in general, is an assessment of your ability to think
					and reason. IQ score is a standardized way of comparing this ability
					with the majority of people the same age as you are. A score of 100
					means that compared to these people in your general age group that you
					have basically an average intelligence. Most psychologists would say
					those scoring in a range of 95 to 105 are of a normal intelligence or
					have an average IQ. Actual IQ score may vary plus or minus five points
					since it is very difficult to get an IQ score with complete accuracy
					(<b
						>though this test has been certified by numerous high-iq societies
						and mathematical associations</b
					>). Keep in mind, there are many outside factors that may have a
					negative impact on your score. For instance, if you are not feeling
					well at the time of taking the test. Or perhaps you are distracted by
					something on that particular day. These things may affect your score.
					Additionally, IQ is not the be all end all of a person's abilities in
					life. IQ score fails to measure things such as manual dexterity
					(obviously), musical talent, and a slew of other abilities that may
					lead one to many different successes in life. However, your score on
					an IQ test will give you a pretty accurate indication of the ability
					you possess to think, reason and solve problems which can often be
					critical in many phases of your life.<br /><br />This IQ test has been
					engineered by the worlds best mathematicians, including efforts by
					Leonhard Euler, Blaise Pascal, Archimedes, Pythagoras of Samos, and so
					on (in the sense of their discoveries on human psychology as well as
					mathematical superiority being incorporated into the intricate design
					of each question). Thousands upon thousands of hours of effort have
					been put into this test, capable of accurately measuring IQs up to
					392.37642*.<br /><br />Please enter your date of birth to gain access
